## What is Goal Calibration?

For Ball-E to be able to shoot balls towards the goal, it needs to know how far away from the goal it is. Goal Calibration is a set of steps where you are asked to draw the bounds of the goal in an image so that Ball-E can calculate how far from the goal it is. This also allows you to understand exactly how far you are setting up your drill instead of estimating a distance.

## What is the min and max range that Ball-E can move from the goal?

Minimum is 5 yards. Maximum is 20 yards.

## How often does Ball-E need Goal Calibration?

For setting up any drill session. Note that every time Ball-E is moved, it requires a new goal calibration.
