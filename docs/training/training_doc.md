# Training Doc

## Are there any steps I must take before executing a training session?

Yes. Before putting balls in the ball queue, please align the markers in the queue such that all 18 balls can be placed into the queue.

## Can I put balls in the ball queue while Ball-E is on?

No. Please only put balls in before turning on Ball-E to ensure safety.

## What is the difference between an Automated and Manual Training Session?

An Automated Training Session is one which uses a pre-existing Drill Profile for training. This session only requires a goalie and Ball-E. A Manual Training Session is one where someone other than the goalie is with Ball-E and physically commands where a ball needs to be shot at. Manual Training Session does not require a pre-existing Drill Profile to exist.

## What is a ‘Load Goalie Profile’ Training Session?

This is an Automated Training Session where a Drill Profile and a Goalie Profile are selected. After the Drill is complete, it is saved to the Goalie’s Profile’s history of drills completed.

## What is a ‘Without Goalie Profile’ Training Session?

This is an Automated Training Session where only a Drill Profile is selected. The Drill is not saved to anyone’s Goalie Profile.

## What is a ‘Manual’ Training Session?

This is a Manual Training Session where neither a Drill Profile nor a Goalie Profile is selected.

## Can I move Ball-E during a training session?

No. Doing so will completely mess up the ball-to-net trajectory algorithm and may cause injuries to the goalie.
