## How to turn on Ball-E?

Ball-E is a two cart system, but all of the control and power signals stem from Cart 1. In order for Ball-E to work, the motor on Cart 2 must be connected to the cables on Cart 1 that allow it to operate as necessary. The blue cable that is not plugged into a motor (it has the more rectangular connector) must be plugged into the motor on Cart 2. Similarly, the black cable (it has more of a square-shaped connector) that is not plugged into a motor must be plugged into the motor on Cart 2. You may also connect the ball feed hose from Cart 1 to the drop chute on Cart 2 if you wish. This is not necessary for the powering up process. Ball-E requires two power outlets that are on different breakers. Once you have identified two independent outlets, plug one of the powerstrips attached to Ball-E into each outlet. Ball-E will begin the bootup process once it has received power.

## How to load Ball-E?

The loading action takes place on Cart 2. There is a platter that can hold up to 18 balls (one per division). Place the balls inside the cutouts on the circular disc while the platter is lowered. To load all 18 balls, the disc must be positioned such that two balls are sitting in part over the drop tube. This platter rotates counterclockwise so make sure you favor the first ball to drop down the tube in terms of spacing. Failure to do so may result in a jam. Once the desired amount of balls have been loaded, raise the platform with the winch to its uppermost position. If the ball feed connection hose from Cart 1 to Cart 2 has not been made, do so now.

## How to start a drill?

Once Ball-E has been loaded and set up in the appropriate position, touch the “Training” button and that will lead to the training menu. Once there, the user can select “Manual Session” to run a training session where the user can input the location and speed of each shot. The other option is to select “Load Drill Profile” then the user can load an automatic training drill. Only start the drill when there are no obstructions between the device and the goalie, who is prepared for the incoming shot. If a “Manual Session” is selected the user must stay attentive to the state of the machine and new potential obstructions between the device and the goalie. The balls can achieve high speeds, so failure to comply with these safety measures may result in harm to the individual or bystanders.

## How to select/create a goalie profile?

Once Ball-E has been loaded select the “Profiles” button from there select the “Create New Goalie Profile” and enter the appropriate information. To load a goalie from, select the “Training” button. Now in the “Training” menu select the “Load Goalie Profile” button and select the desired goalie.

## How to clear a ball jam?

Ball jams are likely to occur in one of two locations, the ball feed or the ball queue. In the instance of a ball jam, the first action that should be taken is to stop the device from running the current drill session. Once the device has stopped and motors have come to a rest, identify where the ball jam is occurring. If the ball queue is not stuck, the jam must have occurred inside the feed mechanism. Remove the hose and retrieve the excess ball(s) preventing the feed mechanism from being pushed into the flywheels. Reattach any disconnected components before starting up a new session.

## How to turn off Ball-E?

Navigate to the Home Screen and press on the Red Power-Off button. If you wish to unlink the two carts, remove the hose and cables that connect Cart 2 to Cart 1. The hose and cables should be removed from Cart 2. Do not remove them from the Cart 1 connections.

## Can I put my hand inside the device while it is running to manually feed a ball?

No. Never put any object inside Ball-E’s frame while it is on and even when the motors are not spinning. You may cause extreme harm to yourself.

## Should I use Ball-E in inclement weather?

NO! Ball-E is currently not capable of conditions that are anything less ideal than a nice sunny day. Temperature is less of a concern than moisture. To protect Ball-E from serious damage, do not take Ball-E outside when precipitation could be expected!
